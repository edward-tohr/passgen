# passgen
Small password generator done in C++. Generates 12 random characters and outputs them.
Random passwords will not contain spaces, parentheses (), braces {}, brackets [], or backslashes \.

It'll also overwrite pass.txt with the output. See the example file in the repo for an example of output.

You can pass the program a number between 1 and 31, and it'll generate that many passwords for you. The default is 5.
