# passgen
Small password generator done in C++. Generates 12 random characters and outputs them.
Random passwords will not contain spaces, parentheses (), braces {}, brackets [], or backslashes \.

You can pass the program a number between 1 and 31, and it'll generate that many passwords for you. The default is 5.
