# passgen
Small password generator done in C++. Generates 12 random characters and outputs them.

It'll also overwrite pass.txt with the output. See the example file in the repo for an example of output.

You can pass the program a number between 1 and 31, and it'll generate that many passwords for you. The default is 5.
